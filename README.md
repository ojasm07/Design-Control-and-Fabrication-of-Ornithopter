# Design-Control-and-Fabrication-of-Ornithopter
Biomimicry, CFD, C++

The objective for this project is to design and implement an ornithopter capable of short-distance
flight. An ornithopter is a robot that flies in a manner similar to a bird by generating flapping
wing motion. Ornithopters can be more efficient, cost effective and environmentally friendly in
comparison to fixed-wing aircrafts. This ornithopter has been designed considering a suitable
mechanism using gearbox for flapping of the wings. The desired purpose of this ornithopter is
stable flight using lift force and forward thrust generated using flapping of the wings. The prime
mover here for the flapping mechanism is the BLDC motor. The gearbox is designed using
optimum reduction of 22.8, so that it would provide sufficient torque and rpm both. 2 test setups
were used to find the ornithopter can generate enough lift and thrust.
